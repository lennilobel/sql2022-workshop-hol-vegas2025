# AI-Enabled SQL Server Lab

The labs in this section introduce you to powerful AI capabilities **coming soon** in SQL Server.
Many of these features are available in **public preview today on Azure SQL Database**, and will be **generally available in SQL Server 2025** as well, when the newest on-premise version of SQL Server is released later this year.

There are two labs:

1. Vector Search
2. RAG Solution

The first lab gets you acquainted with text embeddings and vectors. These are foundational concepts that you'll build upon in the second lab, which leverages vector search for an end-to-end Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) solution over your SQL Server database.
