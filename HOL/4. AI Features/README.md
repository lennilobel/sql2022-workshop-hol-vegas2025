# AI Features

The labs in this section introduce you to powerful AI capabilities **coming soon** in SQL Server 2025.

Many of these features are available in **public preview today on Azure SQL Database**, and will be **generally available in SQL Server 2025** as well, when the newest on-premise version of SQL Server is released later this year.

You will be using AI models from Azure Open AI, which have already been deployed and made available prior to this lab. Note however, that you can just as readily use other AI models. These include self-hosted open-source AI models such as Hugging Face, or FastText from Facebook Research, as well as third-party (non-Azure) AI APIS such as Cohere and Google Vertex AI.

There are two labs:

1. Vector Search
2. RAG Solution

The first lab gets you acquainted with text embeddings and vectors. These are foundational concepts that you'll build upon in the second lab, which leverages vector search for an end-to-end Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) solution over your SQL Server database.
