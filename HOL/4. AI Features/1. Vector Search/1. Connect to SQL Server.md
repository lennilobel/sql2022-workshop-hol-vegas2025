# Step 1 - Connect to SQL Server

In this step, you will connect to **Azure SQL Database** using **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**.

## Why Are We Using Azure SQL Database?

The AI capabilities we are exploring are currently only available in **public preview in Azure SQL Database**,
and only available in **private preview in SQL Server 2025**.

When SQL Server 2025 is released later this year, there will be additional improvments, and these capabilities will be available in both Azure SQL Database and SQL Server 2025.

### Instructions

1. Open **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**.
2. Click on **Connect** → **Database Engine**.
3. In the **Server name** field, enter: `vslive-sql.database.windows.net`.
4. Set **Authentication** to **SQL Server Authentication**.
5. Enter:
   - **User name**: `vslive`
   - **Password**: `HavingFunWithAI!`
6. Click **Connect**.

You are now connected and ready to create your own database.
