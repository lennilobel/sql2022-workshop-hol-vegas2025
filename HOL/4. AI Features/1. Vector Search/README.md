# Vector Search

In this lab, you will learn how to integrate **AI capabilities** into SQL Server using the new **vector** data type and the new `VECTOR_DISTANCE` T-SQL function. These features are currently in **public preview in Azure SQL Database** and will be available in the upcoming **SQL Server 2025** release.

In this lab, you will perform the following steps:

1. **Connect** to SQL Server
1. **Create** the database
1. Create and Populate the **Movie** table
1. Create the **VectorizeText** stored procedure
1. **Vectorize** the database
1. Create the **VectorSearch** stored procedure
1. Run **AI Queries**

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- **Store and manage vector embeddings** using SQL Server's native `vector` data type.
- **Generate AI-based vector embeddings** using Azure OpenAI.
- **Perform similarity searches** using SQL Server’s native `VECTOR_DISTANCE` function.

With **vector embeddings** from deeply trained AI models, SQL Server can find results based on **meaning**, not just words.

Each attendee will create their own **database** and will use **pre-configured AI models**.
