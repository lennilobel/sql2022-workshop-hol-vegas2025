# Step 3 - Create and Populate the Movie Table

Now, we will create a **simple table** to store movie titles and their AI-generated vector embeddings.

## Why Are We Storing Movie Titles?

We will use **movie titles** as our dataset because:

1. It’s a **simple dataset** that helps focus on learning AI concepts.
2. It allows us to see **how deeply trained AI models understand relationships** between words.
3. We can use **AI-powered search** to match movies based on meaning.

## Table Structure

Create a table named `Movie` with **three columns**:

1. `MovieId` - A unique identifier.
2. `Title` - The movie title.
3. `Vector` - A **vector(1536)** column that will store AI-generated embeddings.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Movie (
    MovieId int IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    Title varchar(50),
    Vector vector(1536)  -- New SQL Server vector data type
)
```

Next, insert some movies:

```sql
INSERT INTO Movie (Title) VALUES
    ('Return of the Jedi'),
    ('The Godfather'),
    ('Animal House'),
    ('The Two Towers')
```

From a pop-culture perspective, many of you will recognize these titles, and associate them with a wide variety of attributes, such as particular phrases, actors, fictitious characters, settings, genres, and so on. So just to keep the demo interesting and fun, go ahead and insert a few more titles of your own personal favorite movies.

## What Is a Vector?

A **vector** is a list of numbers that represents **semantic meaning** in terms of similarity or distance. For example, notice how the **close together** the vector values of "The Godfather" and "Crime Drama" are, indicating similarity:

| Text                   | Vector Representation |
|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| "The Godfather"       | `[0.45, -0.12, 0.98, ...]`    |
| "Crime Drama"        | `[0.44, -0.10, 0.95, ...]`    |

Simply put, if two vectors are **close together**, they mean similar things. And if they are **far apart**, then they are more distant.

## Verify the Data

Now run:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Movie;
```

At this stage, you can see that the **Vector** column is `NULL`. In the next steps, we will **generate AI-powered embeddings** and store them in this column.
