# Step 5 - Vectorize the Database

Now, we will **populate the Vector column** for all movies in our database.

Currently, our **Movie** table has NULL values in the **Vector** column. We need to:

1. **Loop through each movie title.**
2. **Generate a vector** by calling Azure OpenAI.
3. **Store the vector** in the Movie table.

## Vectorize the Movie table

Run the following SQL to vectorize each title in the **Movie** table by calling Azure OpenAI, and storing the result in each row's **Vector** column:

```sql
DECLARE @MovieId int, @Title varchar(max), @Vector vector(1536)

DECLARE curMovies CURSOR FOR
    SELECT MovieId, Title FROM Movie

OPEN curMovies
FETCH NEXT FROM curMovies INTO @MovieId, @Title

WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN
    -- Generate vector for movie title
    EXEC VectorizeText @Title, @Vector OUTPUT

    -- Store vector in the Movie table
    UPDATE Movie
    SET Vector = @Vector
    WHERE MovieId = @MovieId

    FETCH NEXT FROM curMovies INTO @MovieId, @Title
END

CLOSE curMovies
DEALLOCATE curMovies
```

## Verify the Data

Now query the table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Movie
```

Observe that each movie title now has a **vector representation** stored in SQL Server.
