# Step 7 - Run AI Queries

Now, let's test **AI-powered search**.

## Why Is This Cool?

Instead of **matching exact words**, our queries will now **understand meaning**!

## Try These Queries

Run these SQL commands:

```sql
-- Famous movie quotes
EXEC VectorSearch 'May the force be with you';
EXEC VectorSearch 'I''m gonna make him an offer he can''t refuse';

-- Movie characters
EXEC VectorSearch 'Luke Skywalker';
EXEC VectorSearch 'Don Corleone';

-- Movie genres
EXEC VectorSearch 'Science fiction';
EXEC VectorSearch 'Comedy';
```

✅ Notice how **AI finds the right movies**, even when the text is different!

**Congratulations! You have AI-enabled your SQL Server database!**
