# Step 7 - Run AI Queries

Now for the cool part!

- Let's test **AI-powered search**.
- Instead of just **matching exact words** or **regular expressions**, our queries can now **understand meaning**.

## Try These Queries

Run these SQL commands:

```sql
-- Movie phrases
EXEC VectorSearch 'May the force be with you'
EXEC VectorSearch 'I''m gonna make him an offer he can''t refuse'
EXEC VectorSearch 'Drunk and stupid is no way to go through life, son'
EXEC VectorSearch 'One ring to rule them all'

-- Movie characters
EXEC VectorSearch 'Luke Skywalker'
EXEC VectorSearch 'Don Corleone'
EXEC VectorSearch 'James Blutarsky'
EXEC VectorSearch 'Gandalf'

-- Movie actors
EXEC VectorSearch 'Mark Hamill'
EXEC VectorSearch 'Al Pacino'
EXEC VectorSearch 'John Belushi'
EXEC VectorSearch 'Elijah Wood'

-- Movie location references
EXEC VectorSearch 'Tatooine'
EXEC VectorSearch 'Sicily'
EXEC VectorSearch 'Faber College'
EXEC VectorSearch 'Mordor'

-- Movie genres
EXEC VectorSearch 'Science fiction'
EXEC VectorSearch 'Crime'
EXEC VectorSearch 'Comedy'
EXEC VectorSearch 'Fantasy/Adventure'

```

Notice how **AI finds the right movies**, even when the text is different!

**Congratulations! You have AI-enabled your SQL Server database!**

Before wrapping up, go ahead and add a few more `EXEC VectorSearch` statements that match up against some of your favorite movies that you added at the start of this lab. Have fun querying on the many well-known attributes of your favorite movies.

Remember, the only **raw data** in this database is movie titles. Yet our AI search capabilities are boundless once we supplement those movie titles with text embedding **vectors** from Azure OpenAI!
